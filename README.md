# devmem2
devmem2 was originally developed by Jan-Derk Bakker in 2000 and released
under GPLv2. After a while, the original download location was no longer
available, but nice folks from Bootlin preserved it on their mirror.

Over the years, the number of patches grew and managing the source code
in the form of patches, applied on top of the original, became problematic
and hence, this repo was created.
